JPC2000
=======

This is a fork of stevegraham's JPC2000

Goals include adding a proper sequence recorder and/or step-sequencer, as well
as maybe some DSP.


Instructions
============

This fork uses rvm and a gemset called jpc.

You should be able to run the server by calling

    bundle install

followed by

    ruby app.rb

You may also want to run guard in another tab to update the served page dynamically as you make changes:

    guard
